/*! This crate implements binding to the Qt API which allow to use QML from a rust application.

    # Example:

    ```
    extern crate qmetaobject;
    use qmetaobject::*;
    #[macro_use] extern crate cstr;

    // The `QObject` custom derive macro allows to expose a class to Qt and QML
    #[derive(QObject,Default)]
    struct Greeter {
        // Specify the base class with the qt_base_class macro
        base : qt_base_class!(trait QObject),
        // Decalare `name` as a property usable from Qt
        name : qt_property!(QString; NOTIFY name_changed),
        // Declare a signal
        name_changed : qt_signal!(),
        // And even a slot
        compute_greetings : qt_method!(fn compute_greetings(&self, verb : String) -> QString {
            return (verb + " " + &self.name.to_string()).into()
        })
    }

    fn main() {
        // Register the `Greeter` struct to QML
        qml_register_type::<Greeter>(cstr!("Greeter"), 1, 0, cstr!("Greeter"));
        // Create a QML engine from rust
        let mut engine = QmlEngine::new();
    # return; // We can't create a window in the CI
        // (Here the QML code is inline, but one can also load from a file)
        engine.load_data(r#"
            import QtQuick 2.6;
            import QtQuick.Window 2.0;
            import Greeter 1.0  // import our Rust classes
            Window {
                visible: true;
                Greeter { //  Instentiate the rust struct
                    id: greeter;
                    name: 'World'; // set a property
                }
                Text {
                    anchors.centerIn: parent;
                    // Call a method
                    text: greeter.compute_greetings('hello');
                }
            }"#.into());
        engine.exec();
    }
    ```

    # Basic types

    The re-exported module [qttypes](qttypes/index.html) contains binding to the most usefull
    basic types such as [QString](qttypes/struct.QString.html),
    [QVariant](qttypes/struct.QVariant.html), ...

    You can also simply use rust type `String`, but using QString might avoid unecessary
    conversions in some case.

    # Meta type

    In order to be able to use a type in a signal or method parameter, or as a property type,
    the type need to implement the [QMetaType](qmetatype/trait.QMetaType.html) trait.
    All the method are provided so you can just implement the QMetaType like this:

    ```rust
    # use qmetaobject::QMetaType;
    #[derive(Default, Clone)]
    struct MyPoint(u32, u32);
    impl QMetaType for MyPoint {};
    ```

    With that it is also possible to put the type in a  [QVariant](qttypes/struct.QVariant.html)

    # Object pinning

    Once an object that derives from QObject is exposed to C++, it needs to be pinned, and cannot
    be moved in memory.
    Also, since the Qt code can be re-entrant, the object must be placed in a RefCell.
    The [QObjectPinned](struct.QObjectPinned.html) object is used to enforce the pinning.

    If you want to keep pointer to reference, tou can use [QPointer](struct.QPointer.html).

    # Threading

    The QML engine only runs in a single thread. And probably all the QObject needs to be living
    in the Qt thread. But you can use the [queued_callback](fn.queued_callback.html) function to
    create callback that can be called from any thread and are going to run in the Qt thread.

    This can be done like so:

    ```
    # extern crate qmetaobject;
    # use qmetaobject::*;
    #[derive(QObject,Default)]
    struct MyAsyncObject {
        base : qt_base_class!(trait QObject),
        result : qt_property!(QString; NOTIFY result_changed),
        result_changed : qt_signal!(),
        recompute_result : qt_method!(fn recompute_result(&self, name : String) {
            let qptr = QPointer::from(&*self);
            let set_value = qmetaobject::queued_callback(move |val : QString| {
                qptr.as_pinned().map(|self_| {
                    self_.borrow_mut().result = val;
                    self_.borrow().result_changed();
                });
            });
            std::thread::spawn(move || {
                // do stuff asynchroniously ...
                let r = QString::from("Hello ".to_owned() + &name);
                set_value(r);
            }).join();
        })
    }
    # let obj = std::cell::RefCell::new(MyAsyncObject::default());
    # let mut engine = QmlEngine::new();
    # unsafe { qmetaobject::connect(
    #     QObject::cpp_construct(&obj),
    #     obj.borrow().result_changed.to_cpp_representation(&*obj.borrow()),
    #     || engine.quit()
    # ) };
    # obj.borrow().recompute_result("World".into());
    # engine.exec();
    # assert_eq!(obj.borrow().result, QString::from("Hello World"));
    ```
